# Progress Steps

![Design preview for desktop](./images/screenshot)

In this small project, I created a progress bar that shows to the user how much they've progressed on a certain step. This is depicted in a colourful way. ðŸŒˆ

This project is built with:

- HTML5
- CSS
- Vanilla Javascript

Process:
This small project used the fundamentals of HTML, CSS and Javascript.The Javascript code allows the user to navigate 'next' or 'prev' and see how far they have progressed within the four steps.
